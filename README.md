I have created a local website using Django Python.

This website is a restaurant app where any guest can make reservation. 
Also, using http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/, after inputing admin login and admin password, admin can create/edit groups, users, create reservations. 

Also it includes general roles edit like:
Administration | log entry | Can add log entry
